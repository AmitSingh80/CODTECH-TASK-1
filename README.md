OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT- RESTFULL API
Objective-A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a way for web services to communicate with each other using the HTTP protocol. It follows a set of principles and constraints to provide a lightweight, maintainable, and scalable way to build web services. Hereâ€™s a simple overview:

Key Concepts
Resources:

Everything in a RESTful API is considered a resource, which can be a user, a document, a collection, etc.
Each resource is identified by a URL.
HTTP Methods:

RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources:
GET: Retrieve a resource.
POST: Create a new resource.
PUT: Update an existing resource.
DELETE: Delete a resource.
PATCH: Partially update a resource.
Statelessness:

Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill that request.
The server does not store any information about the client between requests.
Client-Server Architecture:

The client and server operate independently. The client is responsible for the user interface, while the server handles data storage and processing.
Uniform Interface:

A consistent way of interacting with resources, typically through standardized URIs and HTTP methods.
Representation:

Resources can be represented in different formats such as JSON, XML, HTML, etc. JSON is the most commonly used format.
